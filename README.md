# 👋 Hi, I’m Doğan

I design and build **production-grade backend systems** with a strong focus on **distributed systems**, **cloud-native architectures**, and **performance-critical services**.

My work is centered around solving real-world system problems:
- scalability under load
- consistency vs availability trade-offs
- observability and operability
- long-term maintainability of large systems

---

## 🧠 What I focus on

- **Distributed systems** & system design
- **High-performance backend services**
- **Concurrency & parallelism**
- **Production readiness** (metrics, tracing, failure modes)

I care deeply about *why* a system is designed a certain way — not just *how* it’s implemented.

---

## 🛠️ Tech I use (by problem, not by trend)

- **Go** → high-throughput services, concurrency-heavy workloads
- **Java (modern)** → long-lived, business-critical backend systems
- **gRPC / REST** → service-to-service communication
- **Observability** → metrics, tracing, structured logging
- **Cloud-native patterns** → stateless services, horizontal scaling

---

## 📦 Selected projects

Pinned repositories showcase:
- real-world backend problems
- explicit design trade-offs
- benchmarks and load testing
- production-oriented architecture

Each project includes a detailed README explaining:
- the problem being solved
- design decisions
- limitations and trade-offs
- how it would behave in production

---

## 🎯 What I enjoy working on

- backend & platform teams
- infrastructure-heavy products
- performance and scalability challenges
- systems that need to run reliably at scale
